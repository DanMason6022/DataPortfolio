    <h2>Project Intro</h2>
    <p>Below is my first hands on exposure to Tableau, it was a self led task, which to be honest was pretty basic but I think that was necessary for getting to grips with and understanding the software.
        I chose a dataset I was familiar with and fascinated by, one which could show actual actionable insight to my own habits. Further, it was one I was sure would have tutorials and other dashboards to observe for inspiration, My complete Spotify listening data from the range of 2014 -2025.  </p>
        <p>The aim of this was purely to experiment with the capabilites of Tableau and to build a foundational level of understanding with how to use the software</p>

  <h2>Comments & Insights</h2>
  <p>
    The Listening Timeline immediately stood out to me, particularly the sharp increase in listening during October 2021. Reflecting on that period, it coincides with my first month at university and living alone — a time when I often played music in the background for comfort. This likely explains the sudden spike in activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    The New Artists graph also tells an interesting story. There's a noticeable decline in the rate at which I discover new artists compared to 2019, 2020, and 2021, during which I discovered a total of 2,458 new artists. This plateau suggests my music tastes have become more settled over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Together, these graphs reveal a compelling narrative: most of my new artist discoveries occurred between 2019 and 2021, even though my weekly listening hours have nearly doubled in the years since. It seems I’ve curated a core set of artists I enjoy and now focus more on deep listening rather than broad exploration.

  <h2>Learning & Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Exploring Tableau was an enjoyable and eye-opening experience — and I know I’ve only scratched the surface of its capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    I encountered some challenges, especially with calculated fields, which required a deeper understanding than I expected. I also struggled with the tiled dashboard layout and eventually switched to floating objects for simplicity. However, after some research, I now recognize the advantages of tiled dashboards: better consistency, layout control, and ease of maintenance — especially when scaling or editing the design.
  </p>
  <p>
    There’s definitely more potential in this dataset, and I hope to revisit it with a more advanced skillset. For now, I’m pleased with what I’ve achieved. This project met my goal of gaining a beginner’s understanding of Tableau through experimentation and hands-on practice.
