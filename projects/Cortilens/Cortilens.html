  <h2>About the Module </h2>

  <p>
    This project was part of <strong>NSCI3001: Science Enterprise</strong>, a capstone module offered to final-year students within Durham University‚Äôs Natural Sciences programme. The module is designed to simulate the commercialisation of scientific innovation, placing students in start-up teams to develop a hypothetical spin-out company.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first few weeks consisted of targeted tutorials covering topics such as intellectual property, funding models, regulatory environments, ethical standards, and business planning in science-led industries. Students were then placed into teams and tasked with identifying an emerging area of science or technology to build a business around.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside the group deliverables, we each produced an individual analysis report. This was a critical evaluation of our own team's business plan, exploring whether the proposal would genuinely hold up as a viable commercial venture. The assessment required not only analysing technical feasibility and financial projections, but also interrogating assumptions, identifying weaknesses, and proposing realistic improvements.
  </p>

  <p>
    Science Enterprise offered a unique opportunity to blend scientific knowledge with entrepreneurial thinking, pushing us to go beyond lab-based understanding and engage with the real-world constraints of innovation, investment, and implementation.

  <h2>My Contributions</h2>
<h3>My Role</h3>
<p>
  I served as the <strong>Head of Marketing and Communications</strong> for our team at CortiLens Ltd. My primary responsibility was to develop a compelling communication strategy that would resonate with both investors and our target patient community.
</p>

<p>My contributions included:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Market Research:</strong> Led the design, distribution, and analysis of a 146-person survey, providing critical insight into public understanding of cortisol, rare disease awareness, and pricing sensitivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Brand and Outreach:</strong> Developed the CortiLens brand identity, including tone of voice, visual design direction, and our core message: ‚ÄúEnhancing patient care and outcomes in the rare disease community.‚Äù</li>
  <li><strong>Presentation Development:</strong> Wrote and visually designed the team‚Äôs final investor pitch presentation using key messages, case studies, and competitive positioning data. I also co-presented this pitch to the academic panel along with the rest of the team.</li>
  <li><strong>Strategic Communications:</strong> Proposed and outlined our social media presence, press release pipeline, and stakeholder messaging strategy for partners like the NHS and AstraZeneca.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial and Planning Input:</strong> Contributed to the drafting of the financial report, helped visualise our NHS subscription revenue model, and built the Gantt chart outlining our 3-year research and development roadmap ‚Äî which became a central part of both the business plan and pitch deck.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This role helped sharpen my skills in science communication, digital marketing, data interpretation, project planning, and teamwork under pressure. I focused on making complex technical ideas accessible and persuasive for both public and professional audiences.

 <h2>Key Outcomes</h2>
 <h3>The Business Plan and Presentation</h3>
<p>Our project resulted in a comprehensive, multi-faceted business proposal that demonstrated both scientific innovation and commercial viability. Key deliverables and achievements included:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Full Business Plan:</strong> Authored a detailed 30+ page document outlining our product, market strategy, competitive landscape, regulatory pathway, intellectual property position, and financial forecasts.</li>

  <li><strong>Strategic Investor Pitch:</strong> Designed and delivered a concise, high-impact presentation summarising our value proposition to an academic panel simulating potential investors.</li>

  <li><strong>Innovative Product Concept:</strong> Proposed a non-invasive, continuously monitoring cortisol-sensing smart contact lens, supported by research into enzyme-based electrochemical detection.</li>

  <li><strong>Market Validation:</strong> Conducted primary market research through public surveys and competitive analysis, confirming interest, pricing feasibility, and strong support for a wearable cortisol tracker ‚Äî particularly among younger users and those with chronic stress or rare diseases.</li>

  <li><strong>Funding Strategy:</strong> Built a hypothetical but grounded financial model incorporating grant income, angel investment, and strategic partnerships ‚Äî projecting potential NHS revenue streams and subscription-based expansion into the wellness market.</li>

  <li><strong>Cross-functional Collaboration:</strong> Coordinated closely with team members across scientific, legal, financial, and operations domains to ensure that messaging and planning were cohesive and credible.</li>
</ul>



<h3>The Critical Appraisal</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scientific Foundation:</strong> The proposed use of the 11Œ≤-HSD2 enzyme for tear-based cortisol monitoring is theoretically plausible and well-researched. However, technical elements like RF antenna heating and PET lens discomfort were identified as needing further development and validation during R&D.</li>

  <li><strong>Market Risks:</strong> While targeting rare diseases aligns with a strong ethical mission, the narrow market (less than 14 people per 100,000 for Addison‚Äôs and fewer for Cushing‚Äôs) presents significant financial risk. I recommended treating this niche as a proof-of-concept phase, with later expansion into the stress management sector for sustainability.</li>

  <li><strong>Underestimated Costs:</strong> The original business plan significantly underestimated staff salaries, especially for key roles like CFO, CLO, and research scientists. I highlighted that realistic salary adjustments could increase projected ineligible costs by over ¬£500,000, posing a challenge to cash flow and grant eligibility.</li>

  <li><strong>Pricing Strategy:</strong> I argued that CortiLens‚Äô proposed pricing structure ‚Äî selling each lens to the NHS with just 55p of profit ‚Äî was economically unviable. A modest price increase would still yield cost savings for the NHS while making the venture more attractive to investors and founders alike.</li>

  <li><strong>Long-Term Viability:</strong> I concluded that the business plan, in its current state, would not be commercially feasible. However, with clearer technical validation, more grounded cost planning, and a realistic expansion pathway, CortiLens could evolve into a sustainable and scalable health tech company.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This critical assessment allowed me to bridge technical and strategic thinking ‚Äî applying financial logic, industry benchmarking, and scientific evaluation to challenge assumptions and propose meaningful improvements.
</p>

<p>
  Together, these outcomes demonstrated that CortiLens could be more than a science fiction idea ‚Äî it had the potential to address a genuine unmet clinical need while fitting into real-world healthcare systems and consumer behaviour.
